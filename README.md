Project Title and Description
Welcome to DrawPhone! This is a multiplayer online drawing and telephone game, inspired by the popular game Garctic Phone. Players have the option to choose between two game modes: classic and competitive. Classic mode allows players to take turns drawing and guessing each other's drawings. Competitive mode adds a fun twist where players compete to have the most accurate guess of the drawn picture. At the end of both game modes, players get to see everyone's guesses and drawings in a gallery format.
